## 📏 Rules
1. **Goal:** Arrange falling Tetrominoes to form full horizontal lines.  
2. **Line Clearing:** Completed lines will be removed, and the board will shift down.  
3. **Scoring:** Points are awarded based on the number of cleared lines.  
4. **Leveling:** After every 5 cleared lines, the game level increases and pieces fall faster.  
5. **Game Over:** The game ends when the Tetrominoes reach the top of the board.
