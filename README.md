## 📚 **Data Structures and Concepts Used**
### ➡️ **Data Structures**  
| 🗃️ Data Structure | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| 📏 **2D Vectors** | Represents the game board and Tetrominoes |
| 🎨 **Arrays** | Manages colors and Tetromino types |
| 🧱 **Classes/Structs** | Implements object-oriented design |

### ➡️ **OOP Concepts**  
| 🧠 OOP Concept | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| 🔒 **Encapsulation** | Groups Tetromino properties and game state into classes |
| 👪 **Inheritance** | Defines different Tetromino types from a base class |
| 🪄 **Polymorphism** | Allows different Tetromino shapes to be handled uniformly |
| 🎭 **Abstraction** | Hides complex logic behind simple interfaces |

## 🛠️ **Requirements**
| 💻 Requirement | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| 🚀 **C++17** or later | Language version |
| 🛠️ **g++** or compatible compiler | For compiling the code |

## 📏 **Rules**
| 📌 Rule | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Goal** | Arrange falling Tetrominoes to form full horizontal lines |
| 💣 **Line Clearing** | Completed lines are removed, and the board shifts down |
| 🏆 **Scoring** | - 1 line → **100 points**<br> - 2 lines → **300 points**<br> - 3 lines → **500 points**<br> - 4 lines (Tetris) → **800 points**<br> - Soft drop → **1 point per drop** |
| 📈 **Leveling** | After every **5 cleared lines**, the game level increases and pieces fall faster |
| 🚨 **Game Over** | The game ends when the Tetrominoes reach the top of the board |
